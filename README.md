# Covid19-Data

Covid19 Data is a simple yet useful app for the unprecedented times we are all living in. The app displays the list of all countries that have been affected by the Covid19. 

The app retrieves the list from https://covid19api.com/ API and sorts it by the countries with most confirmed cases. The app uses a list format to display the list of countries, total confirmed cases, and the total deaths. Selecting any country, displays more detailed stats about the Covid19 cases in that country. 


## Instructions on running the projects:

  1. Install CocoaPods on your machine. `sudo gem install cocoapods`
  2. cd to the root directory and do `pod install`
  3. Open the `.xcworkspace` to run the app. Not the `.xcodeproj`
